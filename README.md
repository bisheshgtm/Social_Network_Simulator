# Social-Network-Simulator

As you can see there are two modes in which you can use this program, details are as follow:

### Interactive mode

In this mode, user can interact with the program and will have to provide input at each step as he/she wants, this is how a interactive mode looks like:

#### Load Network

Using this function you can create a network, there are further two more options:

![load](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49767636/83347764-bcdc2580-a340-11ea-87f9-183e6325994f.jpg)

#### Load new network

If you want to load a new network from a network file you should use this option. Sample run of loading from text file:

![load new network](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49767636/83347859-54da0f00-a341-11ea-9d69-3d369d50ea95.jpg)

As you can see the network is loaded when we print the network it prints as expected. Remember **Format of the network input should be exactly same as the network.txt file that is provided**.

#### Load saved network

If you have created a network and made some changes, saved the network using **Save network**. You can load the graph from the saved pickle file.

#### Set Probabilities

It is probability in percentage(%), that how much likely a person will follow another person, or much likely a person will like the post. If you think this application as a "Disease spread simulation", this parameter will mean that how much is likely for a healthy person get affected by the disease.

#### Node Operations

As the graph is a linked-list of a linked-lists, so, A node is representing a person in the network. If you want to:

**Sign-up in the network**

**Get removed from the network**

**Find a friend in network**

#### Edge Operations

Edge represent a connection between various persons in the network. If you want to:

**Add a friend**
We will make "Rex" a friend of "Imran khan".
![add](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49767636/83348313-d54e3f00-a344-11ea-8313-df63dd6df573.jpg)

**Remove a friend**
We will remove "Rex" as a friend of "Imran khan".

### New Post

Its just like making a new post and publishing it. Now, how many will like this post and how many will follow the person in return, depends on the **Probabilities** we set earlier (remember ???)

#### Display Network

Should I tell what this option will do ?
![display](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49767636/83348435-fbc0aa00-a345-11ea-91fb-53e00394babb.jpg)

#### Display Statistics

This option will display various stats like:

- Number of posts made by a person
- Post ordered by their popularity
- Number of likes, friends, friends of etc

![stata](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49767636/83348452-3a566480-a346-11ea-825d-ad2a5e129635.jpg)

#### Update

As we are in simulation mode, we have to update the network manually. What does this **update** means? You have created a post, now people will start liking the post as you update the network. In other terms, it is a mean of progressing through time.

#### Save Network

You have made changes to your network and wants to save the network for future use, don't worry I got you covered. Use this option to save the network as a pickle file.

#### Exit

Use this option to exit.

### Simulation mode

You don't have time to manually create posts, follow, unfollow people and want to automate things. Use **events.txt** to save all the events and run a simulation on them.
Events file can have events of adding a friend, removing a friend, posting, liking etc. See the events.txt for more information. Remember **Your events file should be in same format as the given events.txt**

Once you have run the simulation a **Simulation_Log.txt** file will appear that will contains various stats and other logs
